# Crossword Generator Documentation

## Overview

This crossword generator is a web-based application that creates interactive crossword puzzles with support for multiple languages (Finnish and Norwegian). The system dynamically generates word placements, assigns clue numbers, and provides hints for each word. The application offers a responsive user interface for solving puzzles, including direct text entry, keyboard navigation, and smart direction detection.

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Backend**: Python Flask server that handles puzzle generation logic
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface and interaction

## Core Components

### 1. Backend (Python)

#### CrosswordGenerator Class

The `CrosswordGenerator` class in `crossword_generator.py` is the heart of the application, responsible for creating crossword puzzles with proper word placements and clue assignments.

##### Key Properties

- `width` and `height`: Dimensions of the crossword grid
- `grid`: 2D array representing the crossword puzzle
- `placed_words`: List of words placed in the grid with their positions
- `word_hints`: Dictionary mapping words to their hints/clues
- `word_numbers`: Dictionary tracking numbered positions in the grid

##### Key Methods

- `generate_puzzle()`: Main method that orchestrates the puzzle creation process
- `filter_words()`: Filters input words based on criteria (length, characters)
- `can_place_word()`: Validates if a word can be placed at a specific position
- `place_word()`: Places a word on the grid at the specified position
- `assign_numbers_in_reading_order()`: Numbers cells according to crossword conventions
- `fill_small_gaps()`: Fills small gaps with short words to improve puzzle density
- `_fills_isolated_area()`: Checks if a word placement would isolate parts of the grid
- `_has_adjacent_words()`: Checks if a word placement has adjacent words

#### Word Placement Algorithm

The word placement algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty grid and select a medium-length word as the first word
2. **First Placement**: Place the first word horizontally in the middle of the grid
3. **Iterative Placement**: Attempt to place remaining words by finding intersections
   - For each word, try all possible positions and orientations
   - Calculate a score based on the number of intersections and grid positioning
   - Choose the placement with the highest score
4. **Gap Filling**: Identify and fill small gaps with short words
5. **Number Assignment**: Assign clue numbers in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
6. **Finalization**: Generate the puzzle output with all cell and clue information

#### Boundary and Validity Checking

Extensive boundary checks are implemented throughout the code to ensure that:

- Words fit within the grid dimensions
- No invalid crossings occur between words
- All array accesses stay within valid bounds
- Different grid shapes (square and rectangular) are properly supported

### 2. Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

#### User Interface Components

- **Controls**: Size selection, language options, and generation buttons
- **Crossword Grid**: Interactive grid with cells for letter entry
- **Clues Section**: Displays across and down clues with numbering

#### Key JavaScript Functions

- `generateCrossword()`: Requests a new puzzle from the server
- `renderGrid()`: Renders the crossword grid based on server data
- `handleKeyDown()`: Processes keyboard input for navigation and text entry
- `detectAndSetBestDirection()`: Determines optimal direction (across/down) based on context
- `moveToNextCell()`, `moveToPrevCell()`: Handle cell navigation logic
- `toggleAnswers()`: Toggles between showing and hiding answers

#### Navigation and Input Features

- **Direct Text Entry**: Type letters directly into cells
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Move between cells with arrow keys
- **Smart Border Navigation**: Wrap around to next/previous line when reaching edges
- **Automatic Direction Detection**: Switch between across/down based on available cells
- **Scandinavian Character Support**: Accept special characters (öäåøæ)

## Data Flow

1. User selects grid size and language, then clicks "Generate Crossword"
2. Frontend sends a POST request to `/generate` endpoint
3. Backend processes the request:
   - Loads appropriate word list based on selected language
   - Creates a `CrosswordGenerator` instance with specified dimensions
   - Calls `generate_puzzle()` to create the crossword
   - Returns JSON response with grid data and clues
4. Frontend renders the puzzle:
   - Creates the grid with the returned data
   - Populates across and down clue sections
   - Sets up event listeners for user interaction
5. User interacts with the puzzle by:
   - Clicking on cells to select them
   - Typing letters to fill in answers
   - Using keyboard navigation to move between cells
   - Toggling answers visibility for checking

## Grid Size Support

The application supports both square and rectangular grid sizes:

- **Square Grids**: 5x5, 8x8, 10x10, 15x15, 20x20, 30x30
- **Rectangular Grids**: 25x15, 30x15

Implementing rectangular grid support required careful dimension handling, using:
- `width` for horizontal boundary checks
- `height` for vertical boundary checks
- Separate management of row and column iterations

## Performance Considerations

- **Word Selection**: Uses random shuffling with priority for medium-length words
- **Placement Scoring**: Favors placements with more intersections and central positioning
- **Optimization**: Uses early termination in validation checks to improve performance
- **Boundary Checks**: Implements defensive programming with redundant validation

## Ideas for Future Features and Improvements

### Algorithm Enhancements

1. **Theme-Based Puzzles**: Add support for generating puzzles with a specific theme or category
2. **Difficulty Levels**: Implement various difficulty settings that affect word selection and grid density
3. **Smarter Word Selection**: Use word frequency and difficulty data to create better balanced puzzles
4. **Grid Pattern Templates**: Support pre-defined grid patterns common in published crosswords

### UI Improvements

1. **Responsive Design**: Enhance mobile support with touch-optimized controls
2. **Puzzle Saving/Loading**: Allow users to save in-progress puzzles and continue later
3. **Timed Mode**: Add a timer for competitive solving
4. **Hint System**: Implement a progressive hint system that reveals letters gradually
5. **Custom Styles**: Allow customization of grid appearance (colors, cell size, etc.)

### Technical Improvements

1. **Asynchronous Generation**: Move puzzle generation to background workers for larger grids
2. **Caching**: Implement server-side caching of generated puzzles
3. **Database Integration**: Store puzzles, user progress, and statistics in a database
4. **Testing Suite**: Create comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Code Optimization**: Profile and optimize the word placement algorithm for better performance

### Content Expansion

1. **Additional Languages**: Extend support to more languages beyond Finnish and Norwegian
2. **Expanded Word Lists**: Include more specialized vocabulary and phrases
3. **Clue Difficulty Levels**: Provide multiple clue options for words with varying difficulty
4. **User-Contributed Content**: Allow users to submit words and clues

### Integration Possibilities

1. **API Service**: Convert the generator into an API service that other applications can use
2. **Printable Output**: Add PDF export functionality for printing physical copies
3. **Social Sharing**: Allow puzzles to be shared via social media or email
4. **Educational Integration**: Create specialized versions for classroom use
5. **Competition Platform**: Develop features for hosting crossword solving competitions

## Conclusion

The crossword generator provides a solid foundation for creating and solving crossword puzzles with support for multiple languages and grid sizes. Its modular architecture allows for future expansion and enhancement, while the current implementation delivers a user-friendly experience with modern interface features like automatic direction detection and smart navigation.
